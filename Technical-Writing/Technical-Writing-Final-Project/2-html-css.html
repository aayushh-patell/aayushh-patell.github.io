        <h2> HTML and CSS Structure </h2>

        <br> <br>
        
        <p>
            HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a standard markup coding language used to design web documents. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) may personalize the design and automate specific actions. Most web pages you access, whether they’re articles, social media platforms, or even online shopping sites, most web pages you access are usually coded in HTML.
        </p>

        <br> <br>

        <h3> HTML </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            HTML is formed using a mixture of tags, elements, attributes, and elements.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> HTML tags are keywords that search the language database to find a pre-defined styling associated with the element. This means certain tags, such as the &lt;h1&gt; tag, used for the most crucial heading for your website, have pre-defined stylings to display the item. Although, later, you may also use CSS to restyle the object by changing factors such as font size, font type, font colour, and so much more.</p>
        <br>
        <p> There are hundreds of different HTML tags. Even very experienced web developers cannot memorize every single tag, so don’t worry if you don’t get the hang of it right away. <a href = "https://techspirited.com/all-html-tags-list-of-all-html-tags"> This</a> website provides a detailed list of each HTML tag and its purpose. </p>
        <br>
        <p> An HTML element is anything that is written inside of an HTML tag. An example would be the following:</p>
        <br>
        <p> &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; would be the tag, and however, if you were to write a sentence inside the tag brackets, it would be classified as HTML elements.</p>
        <br>
        <p> There are two main types of HTML elements: block and inline. Block elements stretch as far as they can across the width of a web page and will begin on a new line for every new element. In comparison, inline elements are more generous and only take up minimal space on a web page to fit multiple elements.</p>
        <br>
        <p> Different HTML elements have default assigned values as either block or inline. However, with CSS, you may code elements to go from inline to block and vice versa.</p>
        <br>
        <p> Now that you know the basic setup of HTML let’s move on to its best friend, CSS. </p>

        <br> <br>

        <h3> CSS </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            When browsing the internet, you may have noticed that a majority of websites have the HTTPS prefix in the URL, while some may begin 
            with HTTP. What does the extra “s” mean? Well, simply the “s” stands for SSL, which indicates that the website you are accessing is 
            secure, which is much more preferred.
        </p>

        <p> The selector defines which HTML element is to be styled, and curly braces encapsulate the property and value within. A selector can be an element, class name, or an id for different HTML content, such as h1, div, or #nav.</p>
        <br>
        <p> The property is the aspect of the HTML element that you would like to change with CSS. Some examples could be colour or background-color. There is an extensive catalogue of CSS properties. <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">This</a> website provides a complete list of these properties.</p>
        <br>
        <p> The value is the specific change that is being assigned to the property. Some examples could be 16px for font-size or #000 for color. </p>
