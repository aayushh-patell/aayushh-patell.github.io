            <br> <br>

            Dear Judge Welch,

            <br> <br>

            I am writing to you to ask that you do not reconsider the sentencing of Adnan Masud Syed for the premeditated murder of Hae Min Lee, his ex-girlfriend, back in 1999. The evidence presented in the investigation and at trial clearly and effectively supports the case against Adnan. Many believe that Adnan Syed is not guilty, which is false. Adnan committed a heinous crime. He ended the life of another human in cold blood and got the sentencing he deserves for his actions. Those who disbelieve in Adnan's conviction have no evidence to overturn his conviction, and I will be arguing why he must remain in prison for the rest of his life, including details about him as a suspect and his lack of recollection, Jay's story and more.

            <br> <br>

            Hae and Adnan were both students at Woodlawn High School. Hae was last seen right after school on January 13. Multiple witnesses state that Adnan asked Hae for a ride after school on the day of her murder. Adnan strangulated Hae in her car and put her body in the trunk, which was witnessed by Jay Wilds, a friend of Adnan's who also assisted in the burial of Hae's body which was found at Leakin Park on February 9. Adnan Syed was arrested and charged with first-degree murder on February 28, 1999, after mountains of evidence were presented to convict him. After an extensive and unneeded mistrial, Adnan Syed was found guilty of Hae Lee's murder on February 25, 2000, and was given a life sentence.

            <br> <br>

            A detail to note is that there are no other real suspects in this case. Don, the current boyfriend, was wholly cleared by his work attendance system and boss. Jay Wilds has no association with Hae other than the fact that they had a few mutual associates, which many people consistently back up. Mr. S is also a terrible suspect, strangulation is a highly personal crime, and Mr. S is fully isolated with hardly any connections to Woodlawn High School at all.  

            <br> <br>

            Adnan is the only valid suspect for this case. He is the ex-boyfriend, clearly jealous of Don. He was possessive as consistently backed up by close friends of Hae. He was young and was not cognitively or emotionally mature to get over his breakup.  

            <br> <br>

            My second point is that Adnan cannot remember the day of Hae's murder, even though there were many important details of the day. His close friend and ex-girlfriend went missing. It was his close friend Stephanie's birthday. The police department even called him about his missing ex-girlfriend. Any average person must have remembered many details of that day. Adnan conveniently denies his knowledge of the day, which is a strategy that criminals may use to convince the prosecution that a day was nothing but ordinary. 

            <br> <br>

            My third point is that Jay had no reason to lie, nor was there any evidence that he was intentionally lying. He knew precisely where Hae's car was. This is a detail that even the police were unaware of. Also, why would he confess to the covering of Hae's body if he did not take part in it? Nobody would even remotely think about associating themselves with a crime they were not a part of. Although many may believe that since Jay confessed to a crime, they should not believe him now. Quite the contrary, now that Jay has admitted and is receiving protection from the prosecution, he has no reason to lie for unreasonable purposes.  

            <br> <br>

            I saw a later interview with Jay where he said that the car with Hay dead inside was parked in front of Jay's grandmother's house. Jay had been advised that his grandmother would lose her house because it was his headquarters during the commission of the crime. He lied to protect his grandmother. I find this reason for lying credible, and when I approach the story of that night using this information, the rest of Jay's story seems much more plausible.  

            <br> <br>

            Another argument I have to offer is that multiple studies have shown that the odds that Hae Min Lee, or any other female murder victim, are murdered by a random stranger is less than 10%. Over 90% of women murdered by men are murdered by someone they know. Of those, 60% are murdered by their intimate partner or ex-partner. Most often, females are killed by males in the course of an argument between the victim and the offender. By far, the leading and most reasonable explanation about what happened to Hae Min Lee is that there was an argument between Adnan and Hae over her new relationship with Don that escalated to violence.  

            <br> <br>

            My fifth and final argument is regarding the incriminating cell tower pings. In particular, the Leakin park cell phone pings in the early evening. If Adnan had his phone at this time, which he claims, there is no reasonable explanation for these pings other than that the phone was near or in Leakin park, which Adnan claims to have not been near. Also, Jay's story mostly corroborates with the cell tower pings on the day of Hae's murder, meaning Adnan, who has no proof, but word of mouth is lying.  

            <br> <br>

            Adnan's lies are debunked once again with the Nisha call. Adnan claims that he was separated from his phone when Nisha called Adnan's cell. This also validates Jay's story because the call puts Adnan and Jay together in the car.  

            <br> <br>

            I understand that there are people who believe Adnan is innocent. Some may argue that Adnan had perfectly plausible alibis such as McClain. Asia had claimed that she spoke to Adnan for quite an extended period after school ended while waiting for her boyfriend to pick her up from the library. She even filed an affidavit. Although, she later voided the affidavit and stated that she felt pressured by Adnan and his family to help him out in his case. Also, since there is no access to video footage of the library from so long ago, Adnan's alibi is no longer valid.  

            <br> <br>

            In conclusion, Adnan's case is set in stone. Adnan is the only valid suspect. He does not recall the day, Jay was telling the truth, and the cell tower ping aligns with Jay's story. Adnan's innocence argument is almost solely based on debunked evidence and opinions or sub-par statements. Adnan is a cold-blooded murderer, and he deserves to continue serving his life sentence in prison. 

            <br> <br>

            Sincerely,

            <br>
