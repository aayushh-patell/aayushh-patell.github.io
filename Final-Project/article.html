        <h2> SSL and TLS, an Introduction for Beginners </h2>

        <br> <br>
        
        <h3> Introduction </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Secure Socket Layer (SSL) is a security protocol that's used to ensure privacy, and data confidentiality in communications across 
            the internet. Allow me to elaborate. SSL encrypts data using symmetric and asymmetric cryptography to provide a higher degree of 
            confidentiality.
        </p>

        <br> <br>

        <h3> Encryption </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Symmetric encryption is quite simple. A singular key is used to both encrypt and decrypt sent data. Asymmetric encryption, however, 
            is a bit more confusing. Two separate keys are used to encrypt and decrypt data. A publicly known key which anyone can access is 
            used to encrypt the data, but only specific people have access to the secret key that is used to decrypt the data and view the message.
        </p>

            <div class = "gallery-column image-column-1">
                <img class = "img-1" src = "Components/Images/article-1.jpg">
            </div>

            <div class = "gallery-column image-column-2">
                <img class = "img-2" src = "Components/Images/article-2.jpg">
            </div>
        </section>

        <br> <br>

        <p>
            Without encryption, data is sent in a form known a plaintext. This is where data is not encrypted and can be easily viewed by someone 
            who intercepts the connection. If a hacker finds an encrypted communication, the message is not understandable, and they are unable to 
            view it. This is very beneficial in many situations on the internet, especially when you input personal information such as credit card 
            details, your address, and your social security number. If a hacker gains access to an unencrypted communication stating your details, 
            they may use your information to steal and exploit your identity.             
        </p>

        <br> <br>

        <h3> Web Prefixes </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            When browsing the internet, you may have noticed that a majority of websites have the HTTPS prefix in the URL, while some may begin 
            with HTTP. What does the extra “s” mean? Well, simply the “s” stands for SSL, which indicates that the website you are accessing is 
            secure, which is much more preferred.
        </p>

        <h3> Transport Layer Security (TLS) </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Transport Layer Security (TLS) is another cryptographic security protocol, just like SSL, but much more secure. As a matter of fact, 
            SSL, ever since its creation in 1995, has surfaced many security issues that hackers have been able to exploit. Even after making 
            newer versions, fixing the vulnerabilities they have found, new problems continued to arise. Then came TLS in 1999, which was much 
            more secure than SSL. TLS became more widely used and trusted by corporations and end-users alike. TLS 1.2 is currently the most 
            commonly used version. But TLS 1.3, which is even more secure than its predecessor, is now pushing for further acceptance across the 
            internet.
        </p>

        <br> <br>

        <h3> Certificates </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            When a website host installs an SSL / TLS certification, it includes the public and private key to allow the webserver to encrypt and 
            decrypt data. When a user accesses your website, their web browser will search for the website’s certificate. The web browser will 
            then check the validity of the installed certificate. Once the user’s browser verifies the certificate, the browser creates an 
            encrypted connection between the device and server.
        </p>

        <br> <br>

        <h3> In Conclusion </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Although TLS is much more secure than SSL, both types of certificates are accepted widely on the internet since they have the same 
            purpose of securing one’s website and information. Either way, both SSL and TLS can guarantee increased confidentiality and online 
            privacy for both users and websites.
