            <h2> Biography </h2>

            <br> <br>
            
            <p>
                Hey, my name is Aayush. I'm a guitarist, wintertime skier, and an unshakable technology enthusiast. I spent the first decade 
                of my childhood living in Melbourne, Australia, before my family decided to immigrate here, to Winnipeg, in 2015, where I have 
                resided ever since.

                <br> <br>

                I have always been interested in the ins and outs of technology. As a child, I was always fascinated by cool gadgets I would 
                see, and that passion has continued to the present date. Technology has so many uses. It is used by people worldwide to stay 
                connected to one another, it's used by many people to help keep their lives organized, and much more. I also find it 
                fascinating how so many technological services are now readily accessible in most smartphones that have become essential parts 
                of many of our lives.

                <br> <br>

                I like to explore different activities, but some hobbies that have stuck to me include playing the guitar and skiing. I have 
                been playing the guitar intermittently since I was ten years old, but I only began to play more consistently last year. You 
                may be thinking, how could you possibly ski in a place like Australia? In the South, snow was a rare sight. To experience 
                snow, you would have to drive for hours up steep mountains, but every time I would go on a mountainous road trip with my 
                family, I would make sure to ski for hours. After moving to Winnipeg, I was thrilled to have snow essentially everywhere, 
                and I improved my skiing skills heavily.

                <br> <br>

                I also enjoy travelling with my family. Iâ€™ve visited a variety of locations on vacation. These include Dubai, Singapore, 
                India, Hong Kong, New Zealand, the United States of America, and more.

            <h2> Present Date </h2>

            <br> <br>

            <p>
                Today, I'm enrolled at MITT with a program known as Pembina Trails Early College (PTEC). PTEC is a 4 (or 5) year program where
                students interested in technology take IT-related courses, such as game development, web development, networking, and
                cyber-security throughout grade 9 and 10. 
                
                <br> <br>
                
                Going into grade 11, students may decide to focus on either Software Development
                or Cyber Defence and Cloud Administration for their grade 11 and 12 years at MITT. I am currently in my grade 11 year studying
                software development where I've created a variety of projects in software development and technical writing and I hope to share
                my creations with you
