            <h1> Object Based Programming - Fundamentals </h1>

            <br>

            <p class = "content-introduction">
                Just getting into object based programming? You're in the right place. Many object based programming
                languages have a set of common concepts shared between them. In this article, I will be discussing
                and explaining many of these concepts.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h3 class = "component-1"> Class </h3>

            <br>

            <p class = "definition-1"> 
                A class is a set of related objects that share common characteristics. Classes represent the set of 
                properties that are common to all members of a certain set. A class is like a blueprint for an object.
            </p>

            <br>
            
            <h3 class = "component-2"> Object </h3>

            <br>

            <p class = "definition-2"> 
                Objects in programming can be a combination of variables, functions, and data structures. This means 
                that objects can store values, you can use objects to manipulate values and combine them into more complex 
                objects.
            </p>

            <br>
            
            <h3 class = "component-3"> Constructor </h3>

            <br>

            <p class = "definition-3"> 
                A constructor is a special method. It is called whenever you create an object using new keyword. A 
                constructor enables an object to initialize itself at the time of its creation.
            </p>

            <br>
            
            <h3 class = "component-4"> Accessor Methods </h3>

            <br>

            <p class = "definition-4"> 
                An accessor method is a method that fetches private data that is stored within an object. An accessor 
                provides the means to obtain the state of an object from other programmed parts.
            </p>

            <br>

            <h3 class = "component-5"> Interface </h3>

            <br>

            <p class = "definition-5"> 
                Interfaces are basically classes without code. They can define properties and methods without actually 
                storing data or writing an implementation for functions.
            </p>

            <br>
            
            <h3 class = "component-6"> Abstraction </h3>

            <br>

            <p class = "definition-6"> 
                Abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding 
                the background details or implementation.
            </p>

            <br>
            
            <h3 class = "component-7"> Encapsulation </h3>

            <br>

            <p class = "definition-7"> 
                Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds 
                together code and the data it manipulates. In Encapsulation, the variables or data of a class are hidden 
                from any other class.
            </p>

            <br>
            
            <h3 class = "component-8"> Inheritance </h3>

            <br>

            <p class = "definition-8"> 
                Inheritance is the capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is 
                called Inheritance. When we write a class, we inherit properties from other classes. This helps so that we 
                donâ€™t have to repeat the typing of properties for each new element.
            </p>

            <h3 class = "component-9"> Polymorphism </h3>

            <br>

            <p class = "definition-9"> 
                Polymorphism, at its most basic definition, is the ability of an object to take on many different forms.
            </p>

            <br>
            
            <h3 class = "component-10"> Design Patterns </h3>

            <br>

            <p class = "definition-10"> 
                Design Patterns are reusable solutions to issues that result regularly in a certain program.
            </p>
