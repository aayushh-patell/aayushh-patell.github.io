        <h3> Materials </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Luckily, UNO is a reasonably low-maintenance game with few necessities play. Here is a list of items you will need to play UNO.

        <h3> Strategies </h3>

        <br> <br>

        <h4> Mind Your Points </h4>

        <br>

        <p>
            Each playing card is associated with a numbered point value. Here’s a table of point values associated with different cards.
        </p>

        <br> <br>

        <table> 
            <tr> 
                <th> Card </th>
                <th> Points </th>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td> Numbered Cards </td>
                <td> Sama as the Number on the Card </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td> +2, Skip, Reverse </td>
                <td> 20 </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td> +4, Wild </td>
                <td> 50 </td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <br> <br>

        <p> In games where the play timer has run out, and no player has played all their cards, each player will count the sum of their card points. The winner is determined by whoever has the fewest points remaining. </p>
        <br>
        <p> To count the sum of your cards, do the following.</p>

        <br>

        <ul>
            <li> Separate numbered cards from all unique cards. </li>
            <br>
            <li> Add the sum of the numbers shown on each of the separated cards. </li>
            <br>
            <li> Multiply the remaining skip, reverse, and +2 card quantities by 20 and add to the total. </li>
            <br>
            <li> Multiply the remaining wild and +4 cards by 50 and add to the total. </li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <p>
            To ensure that you have a low number of points, try playing cards with higher number values and save +2 and +4 cards in case someone plays one on you so that you can stack them to have the next player draw more cards.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Although, be cautious because if you have too many unique cards at the end when the timer runs out, you may be met with a hefty point sum. 
        </p>

        <br> <br>

        <h4> Call UNO </h4>

        <br>

        <p> As you know already, you must call “UNO” before playing your second-last card. If you forget to shout “UNO,” if another player calls “UNO” before the next player’s turn, you will be forced to draw two cards. </p>

        <br>

        <p> Likewise, if you catch someone who forgot to call “UNO” when they were supposed to, you can call “UNO” to have them draw two cards. </p>

        <h4> Pay Attention to Colour Changes </h4>

        <br>

        <p> You will notice that players will draw a card from the pick-up pile if they do not hold any cards of the colour of the previously played card. Keep this data in mind, especially towards the end of the game. If a player has only a few cards left to play until victory, you may be able to coordinate with other players to change the colour to one upon which they are unable to play.</p>

        <br> <br>

        <h4> Play Cards Wisely </h4>

        <br>

        <p> Since the game’s objective is to end with the last number of points in hand, it may seem logical to initially play all your highly valued cards, but that isn’t always the case. It is more strategic to keep a few wild, +2, and +4 cards for protection in cases where you may not be able to play specific colours or save yourself from drawing cards that can push you further away from victory.</p>

        <br>

        <p>
            Utilizing these tips will help increase your likelihood of winning future UNO games. Have fun!
