        <h2> SSL and TLS, an Introduction for Beginners </h2>

        <br> <br>
        
        <p>
            Secure Socket Layer (SSL) is a security protocol used to ensure privacy and data confidentiality in communications across the internet. Allow me to elaborate. SSL encrypts data using symmetric and asymmetric cryptography to provide more confidentiality.
        </p>

        <br> <br>

        <h3> Encryption </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Symmetric encryption is quite simple. A singular key is used to both encrypt and decrypt sent data. Asymmetric encryption, however, is a bit more confusing. Two separate keys are used to encrypt and decrypt data. A publicly known key that anyone can access is used to encrypt the data, but only specific people have access to the secret key used to decrypt the data and view the message.

        <p>
            Without encryption, data is sent in a form known as plaintext. This is where information is not encrypted and can be easily viewed by someone who intercepts the connection. If a hacker finds an encrypted communication, the message is not understandable, and they cannot view it. This is very beneficial in many situations on the internet, especially when you input personal information such as credit card details, address, and social security number. If hackers gain access to an unencrypted communication stating your details, they may use your information to steal and exploit your identity. 
          
        </p>

        <h3> Web Prefixes </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            When browsing the internet, you may have noticed that most websites have the HTTPS prefix in the URL, while some may begin with HTTP. What does the extra “s” mean? Well, simply the “s” stands for SSL, which indicates that the website you are accessing is secure, which is much more preferred.

        <h3> Transport Layer Security (TLS) </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Transport Layer Security (TLS) is another cryptographic security protocol, just like SSL, but much more secure. SSL, ever since its creation in 1995, has surfaced many security issues that hackers have been able to exploit. Even after making newer versions, fixing the vulnerabilities they have found, new problems continued to arise. Then came TLS in 1999, which was much more secure than SSL. TLS became more widely used and trusted by corporations and end-users alike. TLS 1.2 is currently the most commonly used version. But TLS 1.3, which is even more secure than its predecessor, is now pushing for further acceptance across the internet.

        </p>

        <br> <br>

        <h3> Certificates </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            When a website host installs an SSL / TLS certification, it includes the public and private key to allow the webserver to encrypt and decrypt data. When a user accesses your website, their web browser will search for the website’s certificate. The web browser will then check the validity of the installed certificate. Once the user’s browser verifies the certificate, the browser creates an encrypted connection between the device and server.
        </p>

        <br> <br>

        <h3> Conclusion </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Although TLS is much more secure than SSL, both types of certificates are accepted widely on the internet since they have the same purpose of securing one’s website and information. Either way, both SSL and TLS can guarantee increased confidentiality and online privacy for both users and websites.
