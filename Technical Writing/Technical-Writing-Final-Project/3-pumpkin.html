        <br> <br>
        
        <p>
            Halloween is just around the corner. Everyone’s setting up their old decorations, and streets are painted with bright orange jack-o-lanterns. In this article, you will learn how to carve your very own pumpkin into a spooky jack-o-lantern.
            <br> <br>
            Here are the steps to carve your pumpkin:            
        </p>

        <br> <br>

        <h3> Pre-Carving Steps </h3>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li> It’s crucial to pick a good pumpkin to compliment the type of face you would like to carve onto your pumpkin. When you’re at the supermarket, choose a large pumpkin with lots of surface area for your imagination to run wild. </li>
            <br>
            <li> While at the store, you may pick up a pumpkin carving set. A simple $5 kit will suffice.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Wash your pumpkin to remove any excess pathogens and wipe it down with a paper towel when you get home.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Think of a face you like and draw the picture of your design onto the pumpkin with a black marker, or trace a stencil.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Use the given knife in the pumpkin carving kit to cut out and put aside a circular lid from the top of the pumpkin and use a large spoon (or your hands) to scoop out the flesh.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3> Carving Steps </h3>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li> Carve out each of your jack-o-lantern components, one at a time, and pop the bits out with your finger.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Remember to carve steadily to avoid messing up your design and prevent any injuries.</li>
        </ol>

        <br> <br>

        <h3> Finishing Up </h3>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li> To be safe, place an electric light in the centre of the base of your pumpkin as a flame may catch the pumpkin on fire which can be hazardous.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Put the lid back on top of the pumpkin to encapsulate the light.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Place the fully carved jack-o-lantern in your desired spot to compliment all your other Halloween decorations.</li>
        </ol>

        <br> <br>

        <h3> Final Tips </h3>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li> To extend the lifespan of your pumpkin, keep it out of direct sunlight to slow decomposition.</li>
            <br>
            <li> Pick a smooth and large pumpkin to extend your canvas space when selecting a pumpkin.</li>
        </ol>

        <br>

        <p>
            Congratulations! You’ve successfully carved your very own jack-o-lantern to add to your Halloween decoration gallery. Have a spooky Halloween!
